# ReviewAnalysis_NLP
The "Restaurant Review Analysis Using NLP" project involves examining customer reviews from restaurants.
By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as handling common words (stop words),
reducing words to their base form (stemming), using regular expressions (regex), creating bags of words,
and breaking down text into tokens, the project aims to gain insights and patterns from the reviews.
Essentially, it's about teaching computers to understand and analyze human language to uncover valuable
information from restaurant feedback.
